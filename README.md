Pods Validation Plugin
===========

Validates form fields for Pods meta data on Custom Post Type edit pages. 

Requires Pods 2.3.18 or later. (Please keep this notice in your plugin and set the appropriate version.)

Instructions
============

After enabling the plugin any Pods meta data form fields will be checked for validity before submitting. 

PLEASE NOT: While all tests on form fields have tested well so far, I have not tested every
possible form field and setting. If you encounter any problems please let me know and I 
will try and tend to them.

Notes and License
==================

This plugin is based on [Base WP Plugin](https://github.com/tareq1988/Base-WP-Plugin) and like Pods and WordPress is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2.
